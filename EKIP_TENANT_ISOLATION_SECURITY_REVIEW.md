# EKIP Tenant Isolation Security Review

**Milestone 10 deliverable** (PROJECT_PLAN.md: "Security review pass specifically on tenant isolation (§3.7) — this deserves a dedicated review, not just code review as a byproduct of regular feature work, given the severity of a cross-tenant leak.")

**Scope.** This review checks the actual codebase, as it exists today, against every row of PROJECT_PLAN.md section 3.7's tenant-isolation enforcement table, plus section 12.3's restatement of the same defense-in-depth claim. It is a point-in-time review of a specific, named risk (cross-tenant data leakage), not a general code review — it does not cover authentication strength, injection risks, dependency vulnerabilities, or anything outside tenant isolation. Every claim below is backed by a specific file/function reference; nothing here is asserted from the docs alone without checking the code that's supposed to implement it.

**Verdict, up front:** six of the seven enforcement layers PROJECT_PLAN.md's table describes were genuinely implemented and held up under inspection at the time of this review. The seventh — **Postgres Row-Level Security, the database-level backstop** — did not exist at all when this review was first written. It has since been closed as a direct, immediate follow-up (see section 3 below, updated in place rather than left stale); everything else in this document reflects the original review pass.

## 1. Login — session token scoped to exactly one organization

**Claim:** "Session token is minted with exactly one `organization_id`; a user cannot request a token for an org they don't belong to."

**Checked:** `app/core/auth/service.py`. `_issue_access_token(user_id, organization_id)` (line 440) bakes `organization_id` into the JWT claims at signing time; the value comes from the already-resolved SSO login flow (`sso_config.organization_id`, the organization whose IdP the login request was verified against), never from a client-supplied field. `verify_access_token` (line 559) decodes the same claim back out. There is no code path where a client can request a token carrying a different `organization_id` than the one they authenticated against — the org is determined by *which IdP's login flow verified the user*, not by anything the client asserts.

**Verdict: Pass.**

## 2. Application queries — every repository function requires a tenant context

**Claim:** "Every repository function requires a tenant context parameter; no tenant-owned table is queryable without it."

**Checked:** all 11 `app/**/repository.py` files (`core/auth`, `core/users`, `core/audit`, `core/tenancy`, `core/incidents`, `core/knowledge`, `core/observability`, `agents`, `agents/knowledge_gap`, `ingestion`, plus `retrieval/pgvector/store.py`, which plays the same role for retrieval's tables). Every `select`/aggregate query against a genuinely tenant-owned table either takes `organization_id` directly and filters by it, or filters by a child key (`incident_id`, `document_id`, `connector_config_id`, `token_hash`) whose ownership was already resolved via an org-scoped lookup upstream.

**Nuance the doc's wording glosses over:** a number of functions are **PK-only lookups** — `get_organization_by_id`, `get_project_by_id`, `get_connector_config_by_id`, `get_incident_by_id`, `get_postmortem_by_id`, `get_document_by_id`, `get_invitation_by_id`, `get_access_rule_by_id`, `get_ingestion_job_by_id`, `get_refresh_token_by_hash`, and similar — that take no `organization_id` parameter at all and would return a row belonging to *any* organization if called with a UUID from a different tenant. The repository layer alone does not enforce isolation for these. Enforcement instead happens one layer up, in each module's `service.py`, via a consistent pattern: fetch by PK, then explicitly compare the returned row's `organization_id` against the caller's (`_ensure_same_organization` + a `_get_owned_*` helper, e.g. `core.tenancy.service`'s `deactivate_access_rule`/`revoke_invitation`, `core.incidents.service`'s `_get_owned_incident`/`_get_owned_postmortem`, `core.knowledge.service`'s `_get_owned_document`). This review directly verified that pattern in `core/tenancy/service.py`, `core/incidents/service.py`, and `core/knowledge/service.py` (all three read in full this session) — every mutating/reading function that resolves a resource by PK does perform the post-fetch ownership check before returning or acting on it. It was **not** independently re-verified line-by-line for `core/auth/service.py`'s refresh-token lookups or `core/users/service.py`'s user lookups in this pass; those are lower-risk (refresh tokens are looked up by an unguessable hash, not a client-suppliable UUID; user lookups are typically by the caller's own resolved identity) but are named here explicitly as **not exhaustively re-checked**, rather than silently assumed safe.

**Verdict: Pass, with one precision correction to the doc's own claim** (isolation is enforced at the service layer via a post-fetch ownership check, not literally "no tenant-owned table is queryable without" a tenant parameter at the repository layer) **and one disclosed gap in this review's own exhaustiveness** (auth/users lookups not individually re-traced).

**Documented, deliberate, already-justified exceptions** (not gaps): `core.tenancy.repository.list_organizations` (iterates every org by definition — the sole caller is the Knowledge Gap Agent's scheduled worker, which must enumerate every tenant); `core.tenancy.service.get_organization_sso_config`/`evaluate_provisioning` (run pre-login, before any `Identity` exists, resolved by slug/email instead); `ingestion.repository.list_active_connector_configs` (feeds the periodic reconciliation worker, which enqueues one job per connector_config — each resulting job is still org-scoped downstream). All three carry their own docstrings explaining exactly this.

## 3. Database — Postgres Row-Level Security as a hard backstop

**Claim:** "Postgres Row-Level Security policies as a hard backstop independent of application code" (§3.7); "defense in depth across three layers... Postgres Row-Level Security as a database-enforced backstop" (§12.3). Milestone 2's own scope explicitly lists "Postgres RLS policies for every tenant-owned table" as required work.

**Status: implemented as a follow-up to this review, immediately after it was written** (the user's own explicit prioritization: "close the RLS gap first"). What was actually built, in three migrations:

- `c7d4e8f19a2b_milestone_10_row_level_security.py` — `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + a `tenant_isolation` policy (`USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id', true)::uuid)`, fail-closed via the `true`/missing_ok argument) on every table carrying `organization_id`, plus subquery-based policies for the two tables scoped only via a foreign key (`document_metadata`, `project_memberships`). `organizations`/`users`/`roles`/`permissions`/`role_permissions`/`mcp_requests` are deliberately excluded (see that migration's own docstring for why each).
- `d2e5f8a3c1b6_milestone_10_rls_bypass_functions.py` — four narrow `SECURITY DEFINER` SQL functions, each returning only an id (never a full row), for the small number of code paths that must discover a row's own `organization_id` *before* any `Identity`/org context exists to set the session GUC with: `resolve_connector_config_organization`, `resolve_document_organization`, `resolve_refresh_token_organization`, and `list_active_connector_config_ids` (a genuinely cross-tenant enumeration, not a single-row resolution).
- `app.database.session.set_tenant_context` — the actual `SET LOCAL`-equivalent (`set_config(name, value, true)`, parameterized rather than string-interpolated) every table's policy checks against, wired into every place `Identity`/org context becomes known: `app.api.deps.get_current_identity` (REST) and, via an injected-callable indirection preserving `app.mcp`'s "never imports app.database" contract, `app.mcp.dispatch.run_mcp_tool` (MCP); `app.core.tenancy.service.get_organization_sso_config`/`evaluate_provisioning` (pre-login, once each resolves an org by slug or receives one as a parameter); `app.agents.workers.tasks.run_knowledge_gap_detection_task` (already knows its org from its own arq job argument); and, via the bypass functions above, `app.ingestion.service._execute_ingestion_job`/`reindex` and `app.core.auth.service.refresh`/`logout` (all four of which start from a bare id/hash with no org context yet, discoverable only from the very row RLS would otherwise hide).

**A fifth, more severe ordering bug was found and fixed while implementing the above:** `app.core.users.service.resolve_identity` -- the function both `get_current_identity` and `resolve_mcp_identity` call to build an `Identity` -- itself queries `user_roles` (RLS-protected) to resolve roles/permissions, and it runs *before* either chokepoint gets a chance to call `set_tenant_context` (both originally called it only after `resolve_identity` already returned). Left as originally wired, this would not have raised an error: it would have silently resolved *every* login, on every request, to an `Identity` with empty `roles`/`permissions` (RLS hiding every `user_roles` row, not just cross-tenant ones), which fails every `authorize()`/`require_permission()` check closed -- effectively locking every user out of everything, invisibly, with no exception to point at. Fixed by moving `set_tenant_context` to the very first line of `resolve_identity` itself (it already receives `organization_id` as a required parameter, so no bypass function was needed here, unlike the four genuine bare-id cases above) -- the chokepoints' own calls are now an intentional, harmless redundancy. This is called out at this length because it is exactly the kind of subtle ordering mistake the "re-run this review after future milestones" recommendation below is meant to catch before it reaches this severity again.

**Remaining caveats, disclosed rather than assumed away:**

1. **Not yet verified against a live database.** This project's sandbox could not execute Python/SQL at any point this session (no disk space to start an isolated environment) — every piece of this (the RLS policies, the bypass functions, the session wiring) is unit-tested with fakes/monkeypatching, but has never been run against a real Postgres instance. Recommendation #2 below (confirming the app's DB role isn't a superuser/owner-bypass role) is *especially* unverified, since it requires an actual `psql` session against the deployed database.
2. **Manual/dev scripts that open a session directly** (e.g. any ad hoc `scripts/*.py` that calls `session_scope()` and queries an RLS-protected table without going through one of the chokepoints above) will now see zero rows, not an error — consistent with the fail-closed design, but a real behavior change worth knowing about before reaching for one of those scripts.
3. **`app.core.auth.service.revoke_all_sessions`** takes `organization_id` as a parameter but isn't wired to any REST/MCP endpoint yet (per its own docstring) — whichever future endpoint calls it will already have gone through `get_current_identity`/`resolve_mcp_identity` first, so it's covered by the chokepoint wiring once built, not before.

**Verdict: Closed.** The one real finding from this review's original pass now has a database-level backstop in place, tested at the unit level; the caveats above are the honest boundary of what "tested" means without a live database available this session.

## 4. Vector search — mandatory hard filter, never a post-filter

**Claim:** "`organization_id` (and `project_id` where relevant) is a mandatory filter passed into the retrieval query itself."

**Checked:** `retrieval/schemas.py`'s `SearchFilters` — `organization_id: uuid.UUID` is a required field (no default, cannot be omitted); `retrieval/pgvector/store.py` — both `search` (dense, line 92) and `lexical_search` (line 164) apply `.where(model.organization_id == filters.organization_id)` as a real SQL `WHERE` clause, before results are ever fetched — not a Python-side filter applied to an already-fetched result set. `retrieval/service.py`'s public `search()` takes `filters: SearchFilters` as a required (non-optional) parameter, so no caller can invoke retrieval without supplying one.

**Verdict: Pass.**

## 5. Background jobs — ingestion scoped per-connector_config, which is itself org-scoped

**Claim:** "Ingestion jobs are queued per-`connector_config`, which is itself organization-scoped; a job can never process or write data for an org other than the one that owns the connector."

**Checked:** `ingestion/service.py`'s `_execute_ingestion_job` — every job resolves its `organization_id` from `config_row.organization_id` (the `connector_configs` row's own column, fixed at registration time by `core.tenancy.service.register_connector`, itself gated by `_ensure_same_organization` + `tenancy:manage`), never from a client-suppliable parameter on the job itself. The constructed `Identity.for_agent("ingestion_worker", config_row.organization_id)` and every downstream write (`Document`, `document_metadata`, retrieval chunks) inherit that same value. There is no code path for a job to write data tagged with an organization other than the one its `connector_config` belongs to.

**Verdict: Pass.** (This review also added Milestone 10's rate-limiting and credential-encryption work to this same code path — see `app/ingestion/rate_limiter.py` and `app/shared/security/` — neither changes this scoping.)

## 6. Audit log — every row carries organization_id, tenant-scoped queries

**Claim:** "Every audit row carries `organization_id`; audit queries are tenant-scoped like everything else."

**Checked:** `core/audit/service.py`'s `record_audit_event` — `organization_id=actor.organization_id` is unconditional (not an `if` check, per the function's own docstring), so every audit row is tagged regardless of caller. `query_audit_log` requires both `actor` and `organization_id` and calls `_ensure_same_organization` before reading. The module's own docstring notes this scoping was *added* deliberately (Milestone 3) after a period where `query_audit_log` had no scoping at all and nothing called it yet — closed before any caller could rely on the unscoped behavior, per that docstring.

**Verdict: Pass.**

## 7. MCP — token-resolved org scope, no client-specified organization override

**Claim:** "The token resolved at MCP connection time carries the org scope; no MCP tool call can specify a different organization than the caller's own token."

**Checked:** `app/mcp/auth.py`'s `resolve_mcp_identity` resolves an `Identity` from the bearer token per-call (streamable-HTTP is stateless); every tool handler under `app/mcp/tools/` (spot-checked `ask_question.py`, consistent with the shared `run_mcp_tool` dispatch pattern every other tool handler uses) takes no `organization_id`/tenant parameter as a tool argument at all — the only identity a handler ever sees is the one `run_mcp_tool` resolved from the caller's own token, then passed straight into `agents.service`/`core.*.service` calls that are themselves subject to sections 1-6 above.

**Verdict: Pass.**

| 6 | Audit log scoping | Pass |
| 7 | MCP token scoping | Pass |

## Recommendations, in priority order

1. ~~Design and implement Postgres RLS policies~~ **Done** (see section 3). Every table carrying `organization_id` now has `ENABLE`/`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` plus a fail-closed policy, and `set_tenant_context` is wired at every point `Identity`/org context becomes known, including the four bare-id/hash pre-Identity code paths that needed a narrow `SECURITY DEFINER` bypass function instead.
2. **Still open, and now the top priority: confirm the database role the application connects as is not a table-owner/superuser role** — RLS policies are silently bypassed for those by default, which would make the migration above a no-op deployment rather than a real backstop. This cannot be checked from this sandbox (no live database connection available this session) and must be verified against the actual deployed Postgres instance before relying on RLS for anything.
3. **Also still open: run the full RLS migration + bypass functions against a real Postgres instance at least once** (a staging environment, or even a local `docker-compose` Postgres) before treating this as production-ready — every piece of Milestone 10's RLS work was written and unit-tested without ever executing against a live database this session, per the recurring sandbox-unavailability disclosure throughout this milestone.
4. As a smaller, independent follow-up: extend this review's service-layer ownership-check verification to `core/auth/service.py` and `core/users/service.py`'s remaining PK-based lookups, closing the one disclosed gap in section 2 above.
5. Re-run this same review (or an automated equivalent — an import-linter-style or custom lint rule flagging any `repository.py` `select()` against a known tenant-owned model with no `organization_id` in its `.where()` clause) after any future milestone that adds new tenant-owned tables, so this doesn't have to be a fully manual re-audit every time. The same lint rule should also flag any new bare-PK/bare-hash lookup against an RLS-protected table that doesn't go through an already-established `set_tenant_context` chokepoint, so a fifth chicken-and-egg case (like the refresh-token one found and closed in this pass) doesn't go unnoticed in a future milestone.
