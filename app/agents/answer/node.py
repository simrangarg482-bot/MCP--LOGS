"""The Answer Agent node (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 6.3 / AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md
section 2.3): reached only when `GraphState.route == "answer"`. Generates
`result.answer`/`result.citations`, applying grounding verification
(PROJECT_PLAN.md section 5.7) before anything reaches the caller.

Owned by: agents/answer/ -- a new subpackage not explicitly named in
PROJECT_PLAN.md section 10's file tree (which lists `graph.py`, `retrieval/`,
`investigation/`, `postmortem/`, `knowledge_gap/` only). Flagged as a
deliberate, defensible addition, not a silent deviation: the Answer Agent's
work here -- generation with citation markers, sentence-level grounding
verification with an embedding-then-LLM-escalation check, citation
extraction -- is comparable in size/shape to the Retrieval Agent's own
multi-file `agents/retrieval/` package, and cramming it into `graph.py`
alongside the state schema and node wiring would work against that file's
own stated purpose ("the composing layer").

Built as a factory (`make_answer_agent_node`), matching
`agents.retrieval.node`'s rationale for the same reason -- though this node
only needs `llm`, not an `AsyncSession`: retrieval and confidence evaluation
are already done by the time this node runs, and nothing here reads or
writes the database.

Failure handling per AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.3: an LLM timeout/rate-
limit, or an entirely ungrounded draft (every sentence fails verification),
is retried -- a fresh generation attempt, not a repaired one, since there is
no principled way to "fix" an ungrounded draft without regenerating it. Only
once `agents.retry.call_with_retry`'s budget is exhausted does this node fall
back to an explicit "insufficient grounded information" response, never a
partially-fabricated one.
