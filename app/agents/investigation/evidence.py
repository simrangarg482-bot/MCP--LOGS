"""Investigation Agent Sub-stage A: evidence gathering -- collection only, no
interpretation (AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.4 / PROJECT_PLAN.md section
6.4). Sub-stage B (`agents.investigation.hypothesis`, task #23) is the only
place raw evidence becomes an AI-generated conclusion -- keeping the two
sub-stages in separate modules, not just separate prompt sections, is what
makes "verified vs. AI-generated" structural (API_DESIGN.md's own framing),
not something a shared function could accidentally blur together.

Searches, in priority order, short-circuiting once `_EVIDENCE_CAP` items are
gathered (AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.4: "short-circuiting once sufficient
evidence is found, to bound latency"):

  1. GitHub evidence (files, commits, pull requests, issues) --
     `retrieval.service.search(..., collection="code")` for file chunks plus
     `retrieval.service.search(..., collection="documentation")` for commit/
     PR/issue chunks (see below for why these land in two different
     collections), both with `include_metadata=True`.
  2. Slack conversations -- `retrieval.service.search(..., collection="conversations")`.
  3. Jira/Azure DevOps tickets -- no connector for either exists yet
     (PROJECT_PLAN.md Milestone 9), so nothing is ingested to search; this
     source always contributes zero evidence today. A real, flagged gap,
     not a bug.
  4. Existing postmortems -- `core.incidents.list_recent_postmortems`, since
     no "postmortems" retrieval collection exists (`retrieval_models.py`'s
     own flagged gap) to search by relevance instead.
  5. Monitoring/alert metadata -- explicitly mocked per AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md
     section 2.4 ("interface designed so a real integration can replace the
     mock without changing the graph"). Returns empty: `EvidenceItem.source`
     itself (API_DESIGN.md's vocabulary) has no "monitoring"/"alert" value,
     only `deployment` among the non-code/chat/ticket options -- fabricating
     a placeholder evidence item under a mismatched source label would be
     worse than an honestly empty result.
  6. Live evidence (`agents.investigation.live/`) -- optional, and only
     reached after the five sources above and only when
     `_should_augment_with_live_evidence` says the indexed evidence so far
     is thin, stale, or this is a real, active incident (see that function's
     docstring). Fetches directly from GitHub's/Slack's APIs, scoped to the
     org's already-registered `connector_configs`, rather than from
     anything already ingested -- see `_gather_live_evidence`.

This module's evidence gathering is deliberately hybrid, not purely
ingestion-backed and not purely live: sub-stage A's first five sources
(above) search what has already been indexed -- fast, and (per
`ingestion.workers.main`'s hourly `scheduled_reconciliation` cron) at most
about an hour stale. Live evidence exists specifically to cover the gap
between "an hour ago's last sync" and "right now" for a genuinely active
incident investigation, without turning the Investigation Agent into a
second ingestion pipeline: it performs a handful of narrow, targeted,
un-paginated API calls per investigation and returns `EvidenceItem`s
directly (see `agents.investigation.live.base.LiveEvidenceSource`) -- it
never persists anything, never produces a `RawDocument`, and never touches
`app.ingestion` (which `agents/` is forbidden from importing at all, per
this project's import-linter contract). Ingestion remains the sole
long-term knowledge-synchronization mechanism; live evidence is a
narrowly-scoped, read-only supplement used only while actively
investigating.

The GitHub connector (`ingestion.connectors.github`) ingests files, commits,
pull requests, and issues (extended from files-only). File content still
classifies as `ContentType="code"` (recognized extension) and lands in the
"code" collection, unchanged. Commit messages/PR bodies/issue bodies+comments
are prose with no code-file extension for `classify_content_type` to key
off of, so they classify as `ContentType="document"` and land in the
"documentation" collection instead -- reusing that existing collection
rather than creating a new "github_events"-style one, per this feature's
"reuse the current pipeline wherever possible" constraint. `_gather_code_evidence`
therefore searches both collections and merges the results, filtering the
"documentation" side down to chunks whose metadata carries a `repo` key
(i.e., actually GitHub-sourced), since that collection could in principle
also hold non-GitHub documentation once a Confluence/SharePoint connector
exists. Each chunk's `source` is derived from its own `metadata["kind"]`
(`"commit"` / `"pull_request"` / `"issue"`; a plain file chunk has no
`"kind"` key at all and defaults to `"github"`) -- see `_chunk_to_evidence`.

Each retrieval-backed source's call is retried per
`agents.retry.call_with_retry`; a source that still fails after retries is
logged and skipped (contributes zero evidence), never fatal to the whole
gather -- AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.4's own failure-handling rule
("an individual source failing ... is logged and skipped, not treated as
fatal").
