"""Knowledge Gap Agent pipeline (AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.6 /
PROJECT_PLAN.md section 6.6): fetch -> cluster -> synthesize -> resolve
action -> persist, run once per organization.

A linear pipeline, not a `StateGraph` -- see `app.agents.knowledge_gap`'s
own module docstring for why (the same reasoning `agents.postmortem.
pipeline` already established for an identically non-branching flow).

Idempotency across scheduled runs: without some way to recognize "this is
the same gap I already reported an hour ago," every run of this pipeline
would create a duplicate `GapReport` for the same underlying topic, and
`GET /knowledge/gaps` would fill up with noise. Before inserting a new
report, each surviving cluster's centroid is compared (cosine similarity)
against every currently-open report's stored `topic_embedding`; a close
enough match merges the newly-clustered execution ids into the existing
report instead of creating a new one. This is the concrete mechanism behind
"never auto-creates a document" staying meaningful over many runs, not just
on the first one.
