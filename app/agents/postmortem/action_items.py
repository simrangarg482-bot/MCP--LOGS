"""Postmortem Agent step 3: action-item generation (AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md
section 2.5) -- "LLM call producing candidate `ActionItem` entries from the
root cause and timeline."

Same plain-text-JSON-prompt-plus-manual-parse convention as
`agents.investigation.hypothesis` (see that module's docstring for why no
LangChain structured-output helper is used) -- the second place in this
codebase asking an LLM for a JSON array and parsing it defensively, not yet
a third occurrence that would justify extracting a shared parsing helper
(mirroring the "not extracted... a third would make the case" threshold
`core.incidents.service._ensure_same_organization`'s own docstring already
uses for the same kind of judgment call).

Every generated item is always created `status="open"` regardless of
anything the model produces for that field -- these are freshly proposed
action items on a draft postmortem nobody has reviewed yet; a model that
hallucinated `"done"` would be actively misleading, so `status` is not
model-controlled at all, unlike `description`/`owner`.
