"""Postmortem Agent step 2: root-cause extraction (AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md
section 2.5) -- "if an Investigation Agent hypothesis exists for this
incident and was never contradicted by later timeline entries, it's the
starting point for `root_cause`; otherwise derived fresh from the timeline."

Both branches of that rule are handled by one LLM call, not two: rather than
a separate "does a later entry contradict this hypothesis?" classification
step followed by a conditional second generation call, the model is handed
the candidate hypothesis (if any) *and* the full narrative in the same
prompt, with explicit instructions to use the candidate only if nothing
later in the timeline contradicts it, and to derive a fresh root cause
otherwise. A single call that already sees the whole timeline is in a better
position to judge "contradicted by what comes after" than a mechanical
per-entry check would be, and it's the one call this step is scoped to
(AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md doesn't budget two).
