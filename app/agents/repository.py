"""Persistence for agents/ -- `agent_executions` only (DATABASE_DESIGN.md's
"agents/ -- owned tables"). Pure data access, same discipline as every other
repository.py in this codebase: one statement per function, ORM rows in/out,
no business rules, no ORM->Pydantic mapping.

Writes directly to `database/` -- an ingestion/agents-parallel exception to
PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.7's dependency list (`retrieval`, `core`, `shared`
only, `database` unlisted). The same gap already resolved three times this
project (ingestion reading `connector_configs` directly, ingestion writing
its own `ingestion_jobs`/`documents` tables, retrieval writing its own
`<collection>_chunks` tables) for an identical reason: DATABASE_DESIGN.md's
"the table's owning module writes it" convention requires *some* module to
hold a direct `database/` dependency for its own tables, and `agent_executions`
is agents-owned, not core-owned or retrieval-owned. Flagged here rather than
re-litigated, per the precedent already established for the earlier three
cases.
