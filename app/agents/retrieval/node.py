"""The Retrieval Agent node (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 6.1 / AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md
section 2.1): turns a raw query into ranked, citation-anchored,
authorization-filtered evidence -- populates `GraphState.retrieved_chunks`
and `GraphState.rewritten_query`.

Owned by: agents/retrieval/ (the graph node -- distinct from `app/retrieval/`,
the storage-agnostic retrieval library it calls into; see PROJECT_PLAN.md
section 10's naming-collision note).

Built as a factory (`make_retrieval_agent_node`), not a bare module-level
function: this node needs a caller-scoped `AsyncSession` (the same "session
passed in, never opened internally" convention used everywhere else in this
codebase -- core/*, ingestion/*, retrieval/*) to call
`core.incidents.get_incident` and `retrieval.service.search`, but a
LangGraph node's own calling convention is fixed to `(state)`. The factory
closes over the request-scoped session (and the shared LLM client) once per
`answer_question`/`triage_incident` invocation (`agents/graph.py`, task #21),
producing the actual node callable LangGraph invokes.

Failure handling per AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.1: an embedding/vector-store
failure that exhausts `agents.retry.call_with_retry`'s retries does not raise
out of this node -- it degrades to `retrieved_chunks = []`, which is not an
error state; the Confidence Evaluation node (task #19) scores that as
effectively zero confidence and routes to Investigation, exactly the case
that route exists for.
