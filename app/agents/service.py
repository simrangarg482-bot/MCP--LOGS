"""Public interface for agents/ (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.7):
`answer_question`, `triage_incident`, `generate_postmortem`, and, as of
Milestone 9, `detect_knowledge_gaps` / `list_gap_reports` -- the actual
`agents/knowledge_gap/pipeline.py` logic lives in its own subpackage (same
split as `agents.postmortem.pipeline`); this module's job is the same thin
wrapper role it plays for every other agent: resolve settings/LLM, call the
pipeline, and (for `detect_knowledge_gaps`) record the run's own
`agent_executions` row.

`detect_knowledge_gaps` is called per-organization on a schedule (`app/
agents/workers/`, since `app.ingestion.workers` may not import `app.agents`
-- see that package's own module docstring), not from any per-question
graph -- AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.6 is explicit this agent is "not part
of the per-question flow."

`generate_postmortem` returns *computed content only* (`(root_cause,
action_items)`), never a persisted row -- `core.incidents.service.
trigger_postmortem_generation` (task #25) is the actual glue that calls this
function and then persists the result via `core.incidents.service.
create_postmortem`. This mirrors `answer_question`/`triage_incident` in one
sense (agents/ never writes to a `core`-owned table directly) but not
another: those two return a fully-formed `AskResponse` because `AskResponse`
isn't itself a persisted row anywhere, whereas `Postmortem` is a row in a
table `core/incidents` owns and gates (`postmortem:write`,
`postmortem:approve`) -- so persisting it is deliberately kept on the
`core/incidents` side of the boundary, not delegated back into `agents/`.

Records one `agent_executions` row per call (DATABASE_DESIGN.md: "the data
source for the Knowledge Gap Agent"), transitioning `running` ->
`succeeded`/`failed` -- the same job-lifecycle shape as
`ingestion.service`'s `run_ingestion_job`. Like every other service in this
codebase, never commits its own session (core.audit.service's docstring on
why); the caller's `session_scope()`/`get_db_session` does that.

Failure handling per AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 4 distinguishes two cases:
- **Expected domain errors** (`app.core.exceptions.EKIPError` and its
  subclasses -- e.g. a bad `incident_id`, per `agents.retrieval.rewriting`'s
  own comment on why it doesn't catch these): marked `failed` for
  observability, then re-raised so a future REST/MCP boundary layer can map
  them to their real status code (404/403/...), exactly the behavior
  `EKIPError`'s own docstring describes ("propagate ... become a 500" would
  be *wrong* for these -- they are not 500s).
- **Truly unexpected exceptions** (anything else -- "a bug, unhandled
  type"): marked `failed` with the error recorded, and a generic
  "something went wrong, this has been logged" `AskResponse` is returned
  instead of raising -- section 4's literal requirement. `AskResponse` has
  no dedicated error variant (a real, minor schema gap, not invented here),
  so this reuses whichever `route_taken` the caller was attempting (an
  explicit apologetic message and `confidence=0.0`) -- the closest honest
  fit the existing shape allows.

`answer_question` and `triage_incident` share the exact same
record-execution / invoke-graph / handle-failure bookkeeping (they differ
only in which graph is built and how the initial `GraphState` is seeded),
factored into `_run_graph_and_record` rather than duplicated -- the same
DRY reasoning `core/incidents/repository.py`'s module docstring gives for
its own generic `**fields` updaters.

`search_similar_incidents`/`search_recent_changes` (added for Milestone 8's
MCP tool handlers, API_DESIGN.md section 3) are thin `retrieval.search`
passthroughs that resolve `SearchFilters` from `actor` before calling in --
exactly the boundary `retrieval/schemas.py`'s own module docstring assigns
to a caller ("`SearchFilters` is a plain value object ... whatever calls
`retrieval.search()` ... is responsible for resolving from an `Identity`").
They live here, not in `app/mcp/tools/` directly, because `app.mcp` may not
import `app.retrieval` at all (pyproject.toml's "mcp never touches database
or retrieval directly" contract forbids that *direct* import outright, not
just the transitive chains `allow_indirect_imports` relaxes) -- `agents/`
has no such restriction, so it is the correct place for MCP's search tools
to route through, the same way `app.mcp.auth`/`app.mcp.dispatch` route
through `core/` rather than reaching into `app.database` themselves.

`generate_postmortem` does **not** go through `_run_graph_and_record` (it
isn't graph-based at all -- AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md section 2.5's "linear
pipeline, no routing logic," see `agents.postmortem.pipeline`'s module
docstring) and, more importantly, does **not** follow this module's
two-tier failure handling either: every failure there -- expected or
unexpected -- is marked `failed` and re-raised, never converted into a
fabricated "degraded" `Postmortem`. `AskResponse` has an honest
"something went wrong" shape (`answer` is just a string a human reads and
discards); `Postmortem` does not -- every field is meant to be real,
reviewable content that a human may click "approve" on. Fabricating one
to satisfy "never raise" would risk a human approving a postmortem that
silently says nothing useful, which is worse than the call simply raising.
