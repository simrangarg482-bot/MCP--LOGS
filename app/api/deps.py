"""FastAPI dependencies for app/api -- database sessions and identity
resolution.

Owned by: app/api. Mirrors app/mcp/auth.py's exact two-call identity
resolution pattern (`verify_access_token` then `resolve_identity`); the only
difference is where the `AsyncSession` comes from. MCP obtains one via an
injected `session_factory` because app.mcp may not import app.database at
all (pyproject.toml's "mcp never touches database or retrieval directly"
contract). app/api has no such restriction and uses
`app.database.session.get_db_session` directly, exactly as that function's
own docstring anticipates ("the future REST layer's session dependency needs
zero new code").

`_bearer_scheme` (added after Milestone 10): a plain `Header()` parameter
(what `get_current_identity` actually reads the token from, via
`_extract_bearer_token`) is invisible to FastAPI's OpenAPI generation as a
"security scheme" -- Swagger UI renders it as an ordinary per-operation text
field rather than the standard global "Authorize" padlock, and at least one
Swagger UI version has a real bug where a value typed into that kind of
field (an `Optional[str]` header parameter) never actually gets attached to
the outgoing request, despite showing as filled in the form. Declaring
`HTTPBearer` as an additional, otherwise-unused dependency fixes both
problems: FastAPI detects any `SecurityBase` dependency in the graph (nested
or not) and registers it in the OpenAPI `components.securitySchemes`, which
gives Swagger UI a real "Authorize" button that reliably attaches
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every subsequent request for every
operation depending on `CurrentIdentity`. It does not change the actual
authentication logic at all: there is still only one `Authorization` header
on the wire, and `_extract_bearer_token`/`authorization: Header()` below are
completely unchanged -- this is additive, not a replacement, specifically so
no existing behavior or test needs to change.

    Deliberately the same two-step composition as
    `app.mcp.auth.resolve_mcp_identity` -- REST and MCP authenticate
    identically, per ARCHITECTURE.md section 6 / API_DESIGN.md's "Identity is
    threaded through every call" convention, so access control never differs
    by entry point.

    `_credentials` is intentionally never read: it exists purely so this
    dependency's `HTTPBearer` sub-dependency is visible to FastAPI's OpenAPI
    generation (giving Swagger UI a working "Authorize" button) -- see this
    module's docstring. The actual token still comes from `authorization`
    below, unchanged; both parameters read the same underlying HTTP header,
    since a client (Swagger UI included) only ever sends one `Authorization`
    header regardless of how many ways this function declares interest in it.

    Also sets this request's Postgres session-local tenant GUC (Milestone
    10's RLS backstop, `app.database.session.set_tenant_context`) once
    `organization_id` is known, so every downstream query issued on this
    same `session` for the rest of the request is covered by the RLS
    policies without any further code change needed at each call site.
    `users_service.resolve_identity` itself already sets this GUC internally
    before this line runs (it has to -- its own `user_roles` lookup is
    RLS-protected too, and needs the GUC set before *it* can query anything;
    see that function's own docstring), so this call is intentionally
    redundant/idempotent -- a second, cheap `set_config` call -- rather than
    the only place this happens: this line's role is to guarantee the GUC is
    set for this identity even for a hypothetical future `Identity` built
    some other way (e.g. a service-account/agent identity that never goes
    through `resolve_identity` at all).
