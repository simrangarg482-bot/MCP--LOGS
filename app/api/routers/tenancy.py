"""Tenancy administration routers (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.2 / API_DESIGN.md
section 1's "tenancy" resource group).

Owned by: app/api. Thin pass-through to `app.core.tenancy.service` -- no
business logic beyond request/response translation (ARCHITECTURE.md
section 6), matching every other router in this package.

Two `APIRouter` instances live in this one file:

  - `router` (prefix `/tenancy`): the original connector-registration surface
    (Milestone 10). Every endpoint here operates on the caller's own
    `actor.organization_id` -- there is no `{organization_id}` path
    parameter, the same "no org override query path" convention this
    router's own history already established (`_ensure_same_organization`
    would reject a mismatch anyway; not exposing the parameter at all is
    simpler and removes the possibility of ever passing a different one by
    mistake).

  - `admin_router` (no prefix): the previously-missing REST surface for
    everything else already implemented in `core.tenancy.service` --
    organizations, projects, SSO configuration, access rules, and
    invitations -- none of which had a REST or MCP entry point before this.
    Unlike `router` above, these endpoints DO take an explicit
    `{organization_id}` path parameter (matching how this surface was
    specified): `core.tenancy.service`'s own `_ensure_same_organization`
    guard still runs on every call, so supplying a path parameter here is a
    convenience for the caller (and lets the URL read as a normal nested
    REST resource), not a widening of what's actually reachable -- a caller
    can still only ever operate on their own organization, exactly as
    `router`'s connector endpoints do implicitly.

  Two deliberate scoping decisions worth stating plainly:
    - `GET /organizations` does **not** call `core.tenancy.service.
      list_organizations` -- that function is explicitly documented (see its
      own docstring) as an unscoped, cross-tenant listing meant only for a
      system-internal cron job, never for an authenticated REST caller.
      Exposing it here would leak every organization in the system to any
      authenticated user. Instead, this endpoint returns a single-element
      list containing only the caller's own organization (via
      `get_organization`), which is the only organization-listing semantic
      that makes sense for a caller whose `Identity` is itself scoped to
      exactly one organization.
    - `POST /invitations/{invitation_id}/accept` is deliberately
      unauthenticated (no `CurrentIdentity` dependency), matching
      `core.tenancy.service.accept_invitation`'s own pre-login signature --
      the same function core/auth calls mid-SSO-login, before any session
      exists. The path parameter is named `invitation_id` here (the
      invitation's real, only identifier) rather than a separate secret
      "token": `invitations` has no dedicated single-use token column today
      (see `accept_invitation`'s own docstring for this limitation, and
      `docs/USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md` section 3 for why no invitation email
      exists to deliver one through in the first place). Treat an
      invitation id as sensitive until a real token column exists.
