"""Pydantic contracts for core/auth.

Owned by: core/auth. Local to this submodule (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md), same
pattern as core/tenancy/schemas.py and core/users/schemas.py.

Supersedes API_DESIGN.md's original `POST /auth/login` / `AskRequest`-style
single-tenant shapes: per PROJECT_PLAN.md's opening note, anything touching
authentication is governed by this document's section 3.3-3.4, not the older
one. The flow modeled here is OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE, provider-
agnostic across Entra ID / Okta / Auth0 / Google Workspace (section 3.3) --
one shape handles all four, since all four speak OIDC.

Two round trips, two schema pairs:
  1. Begin login (`SSOAuthorizationRedirect`) -> employee's browser goes to
     the IdP -> IdP redirects back with a code (`SSOCallbackRequest`).
  2. `complete_sso_login` returns `SessionTokens`; `refresh` takes a
     `RefreshRequest` and also returns `SessionTokens`; `verify_access_token`
     returns `TokenClaims`.

PKCE mechanics: `code_verifier` is generated when login begins and must be
supplied again at the callback step to complete the token exchange with the
IdP. This module treats it as an opaque string the caller (the future api/
layer) is responsible for stashing server-side keyed by `state` across the
redirect round trip -- core/auth does not persist it itself, since it is only
meaningful for the duration of one in-flight login attempt, not something
that needs a database row.

    and group memberships if the provider sends them -- before EKIP has
    decided anything about provisioning. This is the boundary of core/auth's

    claims, extract identity information." Deciding whether these claims are
