"""Public interface for core/auth -- SSO login, session issuance/verification,
refresh rotation (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 3.3-3.4, section 9.1).

Owned by: core/auth. Depends on core/tenancy (to resolve an organization's SSO
configuration) and core/users (to resolve/create the mapped user), per
PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.1 -- the same cross-submodule dependency pattern
already used by core/tenancy/service.py (core/users, core/audit).

Status of this file, stated plainly rather than left to be discovered later:
`_discover_authorization_endpoint` and `_exchange_code_for_claims` are now
real implementations -- OIDC discovery-document fetching (cached in-process),
a real token-endpoint exchange via `httpx`, and ID token signature
verification against the issuer's JWKS via `python-jose`, matching a
key by its `kid` header. This has NOT been run against a live IdP
(Entra ID/Okta/Auth0/Google Workspace) -- there is no registered test
application available to verify it end-to-end, so treat this as
spec-correct-by-inspection, not battle-tested, until it's actually exercised
against a real provider.

One piece is still a deliberate placeholder, not a real implementation:
`_resolve_client_secret` currently treats `SSOConfiguration.client_secret_ref`
as if it already were the usable secret. The real encryption/decryption
helper this should call (`shared/security`, PROJECT_PLAN.md section 12.5 --
envelope encryption via a managed KMS) does not exist yet as a module. This
is called out loudly in that function's own docstring rather than silently
treated as done.

Group-claim extraction (`_exchange_code_for_claims`'s `groups` field) checks
the standard `groups` claim, which Entra ID and Okta commonly populate when
configured to. Auth0 typically uses a custom namespaced claim instead, and
Google Workspace does not expose group membership via ID token claims at all
(it requires a separate Admin SDK call) -- group-based provisioning rules
(`core/tenancy`'s `rule_type="group"`) will work as-is for Entra ID/Okta-style
claims and will simply never match for providers that don't send a `groups`
claim in this shape. This is a known, flagged limitation, not a guarantee of
uniform four-provider group support.

Just-in-time provisioning (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 3.3, step 6) is now
delegated, not guessed at here: `_resolve_or_provision_user` asks
core/tenancy's `evaluate_provisioning` whether a login is allowed to
provision an account (and which role it should get), then asks core/users to
actually create/resolve the user and grant that role. This supersedes the
previous stopgap ("a `users` row with this email already exists" = invited),
per the SSO-provisioning-policy design recorded in ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md:
core/auth verifies authentication and extracts identity claims; it does not
decide who is allowed to join an organization.
