"""Public interface for core/mcp_oauth -- the two operations `app.mcp.oauth.
provider.EkipOAuthProvider` needs from a persistent client registry:
"is this client_id registered, and if so with what metadata/secret" and
"register this client." Exists solely so `mcp/` (which cannot import
`app.database` at all) has a `core`-side function to call, the same
"call the owning layer's service.py, never its repository.py directly"
convention `core.observability` already follows for `mcp/`'s request-logging
path.

No `require_permission` gate on either function: like `record_mcp_request`,
this is MCP-OAuth-protocol bookkeeping triggered by the `mcp` package's own
DCR/token handlers before any EKIP `Identity` exists to check permissions
against -- there is no user session yet at the point a client registers or
presents its client_id at `/token`.
