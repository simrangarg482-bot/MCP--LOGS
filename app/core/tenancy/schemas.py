"""Pydantic contracts for core/tenancy.

Owned by: core/tenancy. Local to this submodule (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md: types
specific to one submodule live in its own schemas.py; only genuinely shared
types live in shared/schemas/). Read models map from the ORM rows defined in
database/models/tenancy_models.py via `from_attributes=True`, so a service can
build one directly from a row (`Organization.model_validate(row)`) without a
manual field-by-field copy -- same pattern as core/audit/schemas.py and
core/users/schemas.py.

Scope (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.2): organizations, projects, SSO
configuration, and connector configuration. Deliberately excluded, even
though their ORM models live in the same tenancy_models.py file:
  - `ExternalIdentityMapping` -- resolving an IdP subject claim to a user is
    core/auth's federation-lookup concern (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 3.3), not
    tenancy's.
  - `ProjectMembership` -- project-scoped role assignment is core/users's
    RBAC concern (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 3.6), consistent with the boundary
    already drawn when Identity/core.users were made organization-scoped
    (ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md #004).

Secrets discipline (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 12.5): `client_secret_ref` and
`ConnectorConfig.credential_ref` below are references/identifiers into an
encrypted secret store, never a usable raw credential -- core/tenancy stores
and returns only the reference, consistent with its "must never do the
actual OAuth handshake" boundary (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.2). It is
therefore safe for these read models to include them. The one deliberate
exception is `ConnectorConfigCreate.credential_ref` (below) -- a caller
registering a new connector still submits the *plaintext* credential once,
at setup time; `core.tenancy.service.register_connector` envelope-encrypts
it (`app.shared.security`) before it is ever persisted, so by the time it
comes back out through `ConnectorConfig.credential_ref` it is the encrypted
envelope, not what was submitted.

`AccessRuleCreate`/`InvitationCreate`/`ProvisioningDecision` back the SSO
provisioning-policy design (ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md's provisioning-policy
entry): "who may join this organization" is core/tenancy's responsibility,
distinct from core/auth (verifies authentication only) and core/users
(creates users / manages roles once provisioning has already been decided).
`grants_role` on the two Create schemas is a role *name* (e.g. `"engineer"`),
not a raw `grants_role_id` -- resolving a name to an id is the service
layer's job (via core/users's role lookup), so callers of this module's
public interface never need to already know a role's UUID.
