"""Alembic migration environment.

Owned by: database/ (ARCHITECTURE.md section 3 -- infrastructure layer).

Wires Alembic to this project's async engine and declarative Base, so:
  - `alembic revision --autogenerate` diffs against `Base.metadata`, which
    includes every model in app/database/models/ (they all import and
    register against the same Base from session.py).
  - `alembic upgrade` / `downgrade` run through the same async engine
    machinery as the rest of the app, using Settings.database_url --
    not a second, hand-maintained sync connection string.

This file is generated once by `alembic init -t async migrations` and then
hand-edited to point at the project's Base/settings; it is not meant to be
regenerated after this point, only edited as needed (e.g. if new model
modules are added and need to be imported below so their tables are visible
to autogenerate).
