"""SQLAlchemy models for the tables owned by agents/: `agent_executions` and,
as of Milestone 9, `knowledge_gap_reports` (DATABASE_DESIGN.md "agents/ --
owned tables").

Owned by: database/ (definition) + agents/ (write access) -- same ownership
discipline as every other models file in this project: only agents/'s
repository code writes here; every other module reads agent results through
`agents`' public interface (`answer_question`, `triage_incident`,
`generate_postmortem`, `detect_knowledge_gaps`, PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.7),
never by importing this model directly.

`organization_id` added beyond DATABASE_DESIGN.md's original column list --
that table definition predates the org-scoping migration (ENGINEERING_DECISIONS.md
#004) and was never revisited, the same gap `audit_logs` and `ingestion_jobs`
had before their own equivalent additions. Without it, the Knowledge Gap
Agent's own query ("recent low-confidence `agent_executions` rows",
PROJECT_PLAN.md section 6.6 / DATABASE_DESIGN.md's own "why this table
matters" note) would have no way to scope its clustering pass to one
organization at a time, silently mixing every tenant's low-confidence queries
together -- the same class of cross-tenant leak #004 fixed for role
resolution. Carried directly on the row (not derived solely via a join),
matching `IncidentTimeline`/`Postmortem`/`IngestionJob`'s convention.

`input_summary` is deliberately JSONB, not the raw prompt/context: per
DATABASE_DESIGN.md, "not the full prompt -- a structured summary for
observability, to avoid storing sensitive full context indefinitely" -- this
table is an execution-outcome log, not a prompt cache.

`confidence_score` uses `Numeric(asdecimal=False)` so SQLAlchemy hands back a
plain Python `float` (matching every other confidence-adjacent value in this
codebase -- `Settings.confidence_threshold`, `ScoredChunk.score` -- rather
than a `decimal.Decimal` the rest of the app would need to convert at every
read site).

    Owned by: database/ (definition) + agents/ (write access) -- same
    convention as `AgentExecution` above; `core/knowledge` reads
    `related_document_id` indirectly (by id) when a human acts on a report,
    never by joining into this table directly.

    `topic_embedding` and `supporting_execution_ids` are JSONB, not a native
    `pgvector` column or a join table: the per-organization row count here
    is small (a handful of open gaps at a time, not millions), so the one
    place this embedding is ever compared against another
    (`app.agents.knowledge_gap.pipeline`'s re-run merge check) does the
    cosine-similarity comparison in Python against the handful of currently
    "open" rows, rather than needing a SQL-side vector index built for a
    scale this table will never reach.

    `status` (`"open"`/`"dismissed"`) is an addition beyond
    AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md's literal spec, flagged plainly rather than silently
    added: without some way to close a report, `GET /knowledge/gaps` would
    show the same recommendation forever, even after a human has already
    acted on it (created the runbook, updated the document) -- a real
    usability gap the original spec didn't address. Nothing currently sets
    `"dismissed"` (no dismiss action is wired up yet); the column exists so
    that action is additive, not a later breaking schema change.
