"""The connector protocol every ingestion source implements.

Owned by: ingestion/connectors/. Per PROJECT_PLAN.md sections 4.1-4.2: a
connector's only job is authenticate + fetch + normalize -- it must not
decide what's worth chunking, must not dedupe, must not embed, and must not
know anything about incidents, postmortems, or confidence scoring. Modeled
as a `typing.Protocol`, not a base class, deliberately: composition over
inheritance, so a connector can't accidentally inherit pipeline behavior it
shouldn't own (the exact rationale given in section 4.2).

`authenticate`/`fetch_batch` are async (both do real network I/O against the
external source); `normalize` is sync (pure data transformation, no I/O) --
matching the async-throughout convention already used across this codebase
(core/auth's httpx-based OIDC calls, the async SQLAlchemy session).
