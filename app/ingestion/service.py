"""Public interface for ingestion/ (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.8):
`run_ingestion_job(connector_config_id)`, `reindex(document_id)`,
`get_job_status(job_id)`.

Owned by: ingestion/. Ties together connectors (task #9/#10), the
processing pipeline (task #11), and persistence (this task's repository.py)
into the one job-execution flow. Depends on core/tenancy (reading
`connector_configs` via `ingestion/repository.py`'s direct database read,
and writing sync status back through `core.tenancy.service.update_connector_sync_status`)
and core/users (indirectly, via `Identity.for_agent` -- no permission check
is performed here, see below) -- both undocumented in section 9.8's
dependency list (retrieval/database/shared only), flagged the same way the
connector-config-access gap was flagged and resolved earlier in this
milestone. Also depends on retrieval/ (`retrieval.service.upsert`) to hand
off each processed document's chunks for embedding and storage -- this one
*is* in section 9.8's dependency list.

No `actor: Identity` parameter anywhere in this module's public functions,
matching section 9.8's literal signatures. Ingestion runs as a separate
worker process (section 4.5), triggered by a scheduler/webhook handler, not
synchronously by an end user request -- there is no human caller to
authorize per call the way core/'s user-facing functions require. Every
mutation still gets an actor for audit-tagging purposes: internally, a job
constructs `Identity.for_agent("ingestion_worker", organization_id)`, the
same convenience constructor `core/auth` and `core/incidents` use for
non-interactive callers.

Each processed document's chunks are handed to `retrieval.service.upsert`
inside the same savepoint as the `Document`/`document_metadata` writes, so a
mid-job failure rolls back the chunks along with the row they belong to --
no orphaned embeddings for a document that never successfully persisted.
`_CONTENT_TYPE_TO_COLLECTION` maps `ProcessedDocument.content_type` onto the
`CollectionName` `retrieval/` expects (see that mapping's own comment for
why it lives here rather than in either module it bridges).

Milestone 10 additions (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 12.5/section 10): (1)
`config_row.credential_ref` is decrypted via `app.shared.security` exactly
once per job, immediately before `connector.authenticate()` needs it --
see `_execute_ingestion_job`'s own docstring; (2) every `fetch_batch` call
acquires from two `app.ingestion.rate_limiter.TokenBucketRateLimiter`
budgets first (per-connector_config and per-organization), closing the gap
`app.ingestion.workers.tasks.scheduled_reconciliation`'s docstring used to
flag as "not attempted here."

    "a retry resumes from the failed stage, not from scratch" is honored at
    a coarse grain here: `failed_stage` records *which* stage the job died
    in (fetch/normalize/process/persist) for observability, but a retry
    (arq re-invoking this same function) re-runs the whole sync from the
