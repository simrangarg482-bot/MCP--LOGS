"""Pydantic contracts for retrieval/.

Owned by: retrieval/. Per PROJECT_PLAN.md section 9.9, retrieval "must never
... know anything about incidents, postmortems, agents, or
organizations-as-a-concept beyond 'a filter value' -- it only knows
documents, chunks, and queries." Concretely: nothing in this module imports
`app.shared.schemas.Identity` or any RBAC concept. `SearchFilters` is a
plain value object -- organization_id, project_ids, permission codes --
that whatever calls `retrieval.search()` (the not-yet-built Retrieval Agent,
Milestone 6) is responsible for resolving from an `Identity` *before*
calling in. Resolving "which projects can this caller see" from
`Identity.project_permissions` is deliberately NOT retrieval's job.
