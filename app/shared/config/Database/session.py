"""Async SQLAlchemy engine, session management, and declarative base.

Owned by: database/ (ARCHITECTURE.md section 3 -- infrastructure layer, no
business logic, sits below every other module and can call nothing).

Every module that needs a DB session gets one through `get_db_session`
(the FastAPI dependency) or `session_scope` (for non-request contexts, e.g.
arq worker jobs) -- nothing outside this file constructs a session directly.
This is what keeps session lifecycle (commit/rollback/close) consistent
regardless of which module is doing the querying...

Cross-module discipline reminder (ARCHITECTURE.md section 2): a session
created here must never be passed across a module's public interface boundary
-- e.g. `core.get_incident(...)` returns a Pydantic model, not an ORM object
still attached to a session. That rule is enforced by convention in the
modules that use this file, not by anything in this file itself.
