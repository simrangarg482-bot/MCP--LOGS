    # clear-answer / 12 ambiguous / 10 no-information; full report in

    #   - Sweeping 0.40-0.80 found 0.40 scores marginally higher on F1 (0.700

    #     for a change; the harness itself flags margins this small.
    #   - More importantly: clear-answer confidence (0.422-1.000) and
    #     ambiguous confidence (0.572-1.000) ranges overlap substantially --
    #     an "ambiguous" question (topically relevant chunk retrieved, but
    #     missing the specific fact asked) scores nearly as high as a
    #     genuinely answerable one, because `top_similarity`/`rerank_score`
