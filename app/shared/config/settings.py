"""Application configuration, loaded from environment variables.

This is the first implementation file in the project, deliberately: almost
every other module (database connections, Redis, LLM API keys, MCP auth)
depends on settings being loaded correctly, so it has to exist before
anything else can be written meaningfully.

Owned by: shared/ (ARCHITECTURE.md section 3 -- cross-cutting, no business
meaning of its own, importable by every other module).
