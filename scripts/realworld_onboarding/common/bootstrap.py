"""The one place in this whole harness that does NOT go through the REST
API. Read this docstring before using anything in this module.

WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST (a real, verified gap in EKIP today, not an
assumption): calling `POST /organizations` -- and every other tenancy-admin
endpoint -- requires an already-authenticated `CurrentIdentity`
(`app/api/deps.py`). EKIP has no anonymous, public self-registration
endpoint at all. Worse: even once an organization is created,
`core.tenancy.service.create_organization` does not grant the calling actor
(or anyone) any role in the new organization -- nobody has `tenancy:manage`
there, so `configure_sso`/`create_invitation`/`create_access_rule` are all
*also* unreachable via REST immediately after registration. And there is
no REST or MCP endpoint anywhere in this codebase that creates a `Role`,
creates a `Permission`, or grants a permission to a role -- confirmed by
reading `app/core/users/service.py` and every router under `app/api/
routers/` directly; the only code in the whole repository that ever does
this is `scripts/seed_test_organization.py`, which does it with raw ORM
access for one hardcoded test organization.

In short: a genuinely brand-new EKIP customer, with zero prior identity in
the system, cannot self-service their way to a first administrator account
through any API this project currently exposes. Someone -- a human
operator, or a script exactly like this one -- has to seed that first
identity directly against the database, the same way
`scripts/seed_test_organization.py` already does for local dev testing.

This module generalizes that exact, existing, unmodified pattern (same
imports, same functions: `core.tenancy.service.create_organization`,
`core.users.service.get_or_create_user` / `assign_role`,
`core.auth.service._issue_session`) so this harness can mint a real,
normally-signed session (access token AND a real, persisted refresh token)
for any number of named personas, each with a distinct role/permission set,
instead of the seed script's single hardcoded "admin" user. Every token
minted this way is indistinguishable, to every REST/MCP endpoint that
verifies it, from one issued through a genuine SSO login -- it is real
output of the project's own signing code, not a forged double.

Once this gap is closed by a real product feature (a genuine self-service
signup endpoint, and a role/permission-management API), this whole module
becomes unnecessary and `01_register_org.py` / `02_bootstrap_org_admin.py`
can be rewritten to call it directly instead.
