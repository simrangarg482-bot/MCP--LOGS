"""One-time local/dev bootstrap script: creates a fake test organization, a
permission catalog + "admin" role granting every permission code the app
actually checks, a fake test user, assigns that role, and mints a real,
normally-signed access token for that user -- so you can exercise every REST
endpoint through Swagger UI (`/docs`) without needing a real company, real
employees, or a real SSO identity provider account.

Why this is necessary: authentication in this codebase is SSO-only by
design (core/auth/service.py's own module docstring -- there is no
username/password login at all), and there is no seed data anywhere for
organizations/roles/permissions (nothing populates those tables until
something like this script runs). Setting up a real OIDC provider (Entra
ID/Okta/Auth0/Google Workspace) purely to click through a login flow for
local testing is disproportionate for trying the app out. This script
instead calls the exact same building blocks a real SSO login would
eventually call (`core.tenancy.service.create_organization`,
`core.users.service.get_or_create_user`/`assign_role`), plus
`core.auth.service`'s private `_issue_access_token` directly (skipping only
the IdP round-trip) -- the resulting token is a real, normally-signed JWT
that every REST endpoint accepts identically to one minted through a real
login. There is no separate "test mode" in the app itself; this script just
skips the identity-provider handshake.

Safe to re-run: every step is idempotent (existing organization/permissions/
role/user/role-assignment are reused, not duplicated), so running this again
just mints a fresh access token once your first one expires
(`jwt_expiry_minutes`, default 60).

Run: python scripts/seed_test_organization.py
