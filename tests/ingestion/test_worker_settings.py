"""Worker queue isolation and Redis DSN handling.

Covers two production failures found during live validation. Both are
configuration-shaped bugs that no connector or service test could catch,
because they live in the arq `WorkerSettings` classes and the Redis DSN
plumbing rather than in any request path.

1. QUEUE COLLISION
   arq defaults every Worker to the same hardcoded queue name regardless of
   which `functions` it registers. `app.ingestion.workers.main` and
   `app.agents.workers.main` both took that default while pointing at one
   Redis instance, so whichever worker polled first popped whatever job was
   queued -- including jobs for functions it had never registered. The
   agents worker would grab `run_ingestion_job_task`, fail it permanently
   with `JobExecutionFailed: function not found` (arq does not requeue a
   job it cannot resolve), and the ingestion job simply vanished. Both
   workers running at once is the normal deployment shape, so this was not
   an edge case.

2. redis:// vs rediss://
   Workers could not reach Redis at all. The root cause was a `.env` URL
   using the TLS scheme against a plaintext endpoint, NOT a code defect --
   `RedisSettings.from_dsn` maps the scheme to the TLS flag correctly in
   both directions. The tests below pin that mapping so a future change
   that drops the scheme, hardcodes `ssl`, or normalises the URL cannot
   silently reintroduce a connection failure that looks like this one.
